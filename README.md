# React Simple Line Chart &nbsp; ![soon](https://badgen.net/badge/status/coming%20soon/green?icon=)

A simple responsive component for rendering beautifully simple line charts.

&nbsp;
## Features ✅
- Animated draw ✍️
- Simple
- Line colour and width
- Hoverable, animated data points
- UI/styles out of the box 🎨
- Responsive
- Support for different dataset structures
- Multiple lines
- ⚡️ fast - built using SVG

&nbsp;
## Why Use It? 🚀
- There aren't any react charting libraries that support a basic draw animation out the box
- Most chart libraries are overwhelming with a **lot** of customisation, props and configuration
- Most chart libraries require very specific formats of data, meaning you usually have to apply some normalisation to get it in the right format
- Beautiful, scalable and responsive out of the box, meaning no fixed heights, widths or need to style yourself

&nbsp;
## What It Doesn't Do ❌
- Replace proper charting libraries (depending on your needs), such as ChartJS and D3, which offer a plethora of customisation and options
- Support chart types other than line
- Grids/axis

&nbsp;
## Installation 🛠
`yarn add react-simple-line-chart` or `npm install react-simple-line-chart`
